# Very Simple Coming Soon Page WordPress Plugin

This plugin provides a very simple "Coming Soon" page for your website. When enabled, visitors who are not logged in will see the coming soon page, while users who are logged in to the WordPress admin will see the actual website. This allows you to build and modify your website without showing incomplete changes to your visitors. The plugin also includes settings for customizing the message, adding an image, and customizing the background color and text color of the coming soon page.
